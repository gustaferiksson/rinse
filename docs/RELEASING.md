# Releasing Rinse

Rinse ships as a Developer ID signed and notarized app through GitHub Releases and a Homebrew cask. Installed
copies update themselves: `AppUpdater` checks `releases/latest` on launch, every 24 hours and on wake, downloads
`Rinse-<version>.zip`, verifies its code signature (team `82K3YC8HVF`, identifier `dev.gustaf.Rinse`), stages it
next to the installed app and swaps it in on quit or on "Install Rinse <version> and Relaunch" in the menu.

## How the pipeline works

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs on a `v*` tag and calls the shared `gustaferiksson/macos-release` workflow:

```
git tag v1.2.0  →  push  →  [release.yml]
                              ├─ build.sh         (Developer ID, hardened runtime, timestamp)
                              ├─ notarytool       (Apple ID + app-specific password)
                              ├─ ditto → Rinse-1.2.0.zip
                              ├─ gh release create (attaches the zip)
                              └─ bump Casks/rinse.rb in gustaferiksson/homebrew-tap
```

The tag sets the version (`v1.2.0` → `CFBundleShortVersionString` `1.2.0`); the build number is the Actions run
number. The updater depends on three things staying in lockstep: the repo `gustaferiksson/rinse`, the tag format
`v<version>`, and the asset name `Rinse-<version>.zip` (the workflow's `name: Rinse`).

## One-time setup

1. Create the GitHub repo `gustaferiksson/rinse` and push `main`. Releases must be public for the updater to see them.
2. Add `Casks/rinse.rb` to `gustaferiksson/homebrew-tap` (copy `Casks/amped.rb`, placeholder `version`/`sha256`).
   The workflow only rewrites those two lines and fails if the file is missing.
3. Add the secrets in the rinse repo (same values as amped's):

   ```sh
   gh secret set APPLE_CERT_P12 < <(base64 -i ~/Downloads/DeveloperID.p12)
   gh secret set APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD
   gh secret set NOTARY_APPLE_ID
   gh secret set NOTARY_PASSWORD
   gh secret set TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN
   ```

   The preflight step fails the run if any is empty, and the tag must be on `main`.

## Every release

```sh
git tag v1.0 && git push origin v1.0
gh run watch
```

Existing installs pick it up within a day, or immediately via "Check for Updates…" in the menu bar menu.

## Notes

- Local builds are stamped `<git describe>-local` and never check for updates on their own (a manual check still
  works). Debug builds never update.
- An install in a folder the user can't write to (for example a root-owned `/Applications` copy) reports that it
  can't update itself, and a manual check opens the releases page instead.
- Local release without CI: see [`SHIPPING.md`](../SHIPPING.md).
